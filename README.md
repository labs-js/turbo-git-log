# turbo-git-log

**Turbo git log command** -> Semantic git logs according your commit convention.

#### This lib is part of the [Turbo Git](https://github.com/labs-js/turbo-git) -> Making your git even more awesome ðŸ˜ŽðŸ™Œ

## how to use it:

```
npm install turbo-git-log
```

And then from the code anytime that you want to call the turbo git log:

```
require('turbo-git-log')()
```

This will print out the command output with the **Turbo Log**. The colors will be apply only if the commit follow the obtained commit convention. 
> Note: The commit convention will be obtained by the `.turbogit` config file on the git repo. If this file is not on your repo this will use the default convention got by the package [turbo-git-config](https://github.com/labs-js/turbo-git-config/)


## What do I get? 

> Well now you can see your git log with semantics commits. So.. the colors on the git log have sense now:
